          Currently I am studying the last semester of Electronic Engineering
          and Telecommunications at the University of Cauca, Colombia. Thanks to
          my curiosity to learn new things, I have knowledge in different areas
          such as web development (Frontend and Backend), machine learning and
          artificial intelligence.
