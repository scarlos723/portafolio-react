          I am a self motivated engineer student who likes to create web
          development projects for the community interested in exposing their
          services or content.
          <br />
          Currently I am studying the last semester of Electronic Engineering
          and Telecommunications at the University of Cauca, Colombia. Thanks to
          my curiosity to learn new things, I have knowledge in different areas
          such as web development (Frontend and Backend), machine learning and
          artificial intelligence.
